# KingdomSails

This Wurm Unlimited mod adds in a ton of new textures for all ships (with sails).

You can craft a new sail item and apply that to any type of ship to put on the new texture.

Requires a working serverpacks and **the latest** version of [ModelMeImpressed](https://github.com/Tyoda/ModelMeImpressed)

***Note that this serverpack is very big. At almost 200 megabytes 
it might be a bit of a bother when new people join, and they have to download
it (and the server might experience a bit of lag).***
